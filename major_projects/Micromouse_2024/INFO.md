# The Micromouse project

An attempt to actually finish a proper robotics project.

## On the table:

Creation of a system aimed for creation and debugging of test labirynths. Best if related to the exploration and pathfinding testbench in the later stages.

## Current idea:

Bitmap creation and analisys - this would allow for easy conversion between graphical and code-based representation of the labirytnh. This approach could also utilise elements already created in previous projects.

## To do:

Implementation of a grapical representation of a labirynth in memory for bugtesting purposes.
