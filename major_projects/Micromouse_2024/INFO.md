# The Micromouse project

An attempt to actually finish a proper robotics project.

## On the table:

Implementation and testing of a simple exploration algorythm.

## Current idea:

The algorythm will be focusing on the recognition of unnecessary labirynth parts and marking them as "to be ignored" in order to minimise the exploration time.

## To do:

Implementation of a simplified exploration and floodfill algorythms for bug testing and improvement.
Also - testing materials - we need them labirynths.
