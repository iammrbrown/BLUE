# The Micromouse project

An attempt to actually finish a proper robotics project.

## On the table:

Creation of a system aimed for creation and debugging of test labirynths. Best if related to the exploration and pathfinding testbench in the later stages.

## Current idea:

Bitmap creation and analisys - this would allow for easy conversion between graphical and code-based representation of the labirytnh. This approach could also utilise elements already created in previous projects.

## To do:

Main obstacle of the idea are the specific in bitmap representation between MS Paint and other software. Digressions in things like header encoding or color representation could glitch the image interpretation in all stages.
