# Micromouse testing labirynth
*Last edit: 06.04.2024*

## Overview:

A modular, easily interchangeable and relatively cheap labirynth design for Micromouse competition.

## Construction:

Attached files are clamps responsible for holding the wall in place. They come in 5mm (home testing) and 12mm (competition) size. 

The dimensions of the clamps are matched to 8mm diameter grooved wooden dowel. The grooves match with the bumps on the internal circumference of the clamp, providing a positioning reference.

These can be slotted into properly sized holes in the labirynth floor and fitted with matching wall fragments.

## Production:

My clamps were cut on a 150W lasercutter, from 4mm PMMA. The strength of the part was more than sufficient - I'd wager 3mm PMMA would easily do as well (and be much easier to work with).

There's also a nice aspect to this kind of procesess - cutting lines don't have to be parallel to the material as long as they're parallel to themselves - even if the outcome is a little crooked, the clamping jaws and the hole will match and the wall will slot nicely.

I'm quite sure it's also possible to 3D print the elements, but it would take ages and the elements may not withstand the forces of the fitting process, unless printed from high-strength materials.
