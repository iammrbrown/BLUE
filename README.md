# The BLUE Initiative

Welcome, weary traveller, to our humble corner of the internet. Get some rest, eggs are almost ready.

## What is BLUE?

A project aimed to invoke and promote creativity in myself and other collaborators. Open source and open hardware. 

## Why is BLUE?

Creativity is hard, and it's dangerous to do alone. It's just something to help, take it!

## How is BLUE?

Just getting started, ask later :D
